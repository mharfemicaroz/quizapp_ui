They were the first to discover that a long, narrow wing shape is ideal for flight. They figured out how to move the vehicle freely, not just across land but up and down on a cushion of air. They built a moveable part of the tail to control the pitch of their craft as it tendency to swerve off course. They devised a pulley system that warped the shape of the wings midflight to turn their wind-tunnel experiments to design the first effective airplane propellers.
