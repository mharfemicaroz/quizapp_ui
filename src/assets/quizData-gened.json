They were the first to discover that a long, narrow wing shape is ideal for flight. They figured out how to move the vehicle freely, not just across land but up and down on a cushion of air. They built a moveable part of the tail to control the pitch of their craft as it tendency to swerve off course. They devised a pulley system that warped the shape of the wings midflight to turn their wind-tunnel experiments to design the first effective airplane propellers.

Isang kagyat ng alinlangan sa \nbuhay- isang kahig isang tuka- simbolo ng pagkamaralita. Wala akong magawa kundi itistis sa mga salita ang nakikitang anyo ng aming buhay. Kapalaran o sandigan ng pag-asa? Kung basal naman ang aking tinig sapagkat birhen akong nangulila upang lumaya. Subali’t ang sagot ay kung ang pawis ko’y kapalit ng hinaing at sigaw ng pagdurusa. SAAN NGA BA TUTUNGO ANG BUHAY KUNG SA TAGPI-TAGPING DAMPA NAROON ANG ULAM NA TUYO AT IDINIDILDIL NA ASIN UPANG BIGYANG-LASA ANG KANIYANG ISINUSUBO? Wala akong karapatang magsalita. Ang tinig ko ay paos. Ngunit ang ungol ko’y pumaimbulog sa langit at sa libingan ng mga buhay doon ko dinaranas ang misteryo ng buhay.  \n\nAno ang ibig sabihin ng “isang kahig, isang tuka?”",
